# 🎉 DataTable Issues Completely Resolved!

## ✅ **ALL ISSUES FIXED**

### 1. **Variable Name Mismatch - FIXED** ✅
**Problem**: `Undefined variable $productCategory` in action view
**Solution**: Fixed controller to pass `$productCategory` instead of `$productcategory`
**File**: `app/Http/Controllers/ProductCategoryController.php` line 60

### 2. **Column Search Errors - FIXED** ✅
**Problem**: SQL errors for non-existent columns like `products_count`, `category`, `price`
**Solution**: Added proper `filterColumn` methods for all searchable columns
**Files Fixed**:
- `ProductCategoryController.php` - Added filterColumn for name, description, status, etc.
- `ProductController.php` - Added filterColumn for name, category, sku, price, stock, creator
- `StoreController.php` - Added filterColumn for name, provider, status, products_count

### 3. **Missing DataTable Columns - FIXED** ✅
**Problem**: DataTable requesting unknown parameters like 'price', 'products_count'
**Solution**: Added proper column definitions with `addColumn` methods
**Fixes**:
- Added `price` column for products (formatted with getPriceFormat)
- Added `products_count` column for stores (with withCount query)
- Added `category` column for products (with relationship data)
- Added `creator` column for products (with badge styling)

### 4. **Query Builder Issues - FIXED** ✅
**Problem**: `Call to undefined method query()` on Eloquent Builder
**Solution**: Removed redundant `->query()` calls from:
- `ProductController.php` line 37
- `StoreController.php` line 37
- `OrderController.php` line 46

### 5. **Order Loading Issue - FIXED** ✅
**Problem**: Orders not loading due to SoftDeletes on OrderItem model
**Solution**: Changed `OrderItem` to extend `Model` instead of `BaseModel`
**File**: `app/Models/OrderItem.php` - Removed SoftDeletes dependency

### 6. **Missing View Files - FIXED** ✅
**Problem**: Missing `product.view` and `store.view` files
**Solution**: Created comprehensive view files with:
- Product details with image, category, price, stock, variants
- Store details with provider, location, business hours, products
**Files Created**:
- `resources/views/product/view.blade.php`
- `resources/views/store/view.blade.php`
